# EA Sports College Football Feature Simulation

This repo contains my work for the EA Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program (Forage).  
Tasks completed:  
- Proposed a new gameplay feature (see `FeatureProposal.pdf`).  
- Designed a UML class diagram (`ClassDiagram.uml` and `ClassDiagram.pdf`).  
- Implemented feature code in C++ (`FootballFeature.cpp`).  
- Patched a bug and optimized data structures in the codebase.  

## Repo Structure
- `/docs` → Feature Proposal (PDF) + Class Diagram exports  
- `/src` → C++ code (FootballFeature.cpp, header files, etc.)
